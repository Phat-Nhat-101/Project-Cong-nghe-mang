Overview
The AI Interview Platform is a lightweight full‑stack web application for delivering recorded interview sessions.
Candidates can join an interview session, answer randomized questions, record video responses in the browser, and submit transcripts and facial‑expression metadata. Recruiters or interviewers can list sessions, open a session folder, watch per‑question videos, and read the metadata.
